# Example Vue app - Github Explorer

This is a simple example Nuxt.js (Vue) app to explore Github repos by user.


## Functionality

The default page shows a search box to search for github users.

You can click on a user to view some details of that user.
This also includes a list of public repos of that user.

You can mark repos as favorite, which will be stored in a cookie. 
You can also view a list of all favorited repos for yourself.

This app uses Nuxt.js, and as such features server rendering and rehydration.

## Running it
